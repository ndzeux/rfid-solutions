            <h3>Printable Flexible anti-metal label(EN)</h3>
            <p>
                This label is an electronic label encapsulated with a special material, which technically solves the problem that ordinary anti-metal labels cannot be attached to irregular or curved metals, such as metal containers, steel pipes, etc. Attaching the anti-metal electronic tag to the metal has good reading performance, and the reading distance is longer than that of non-metal objects. Comply with EPC C1G2 (ISO 18000-6C) standard, and can use RFID printer to print and write codes.
                <br>
                (1) Compatible with mainstream RFID printers in the market
                <br>
                (2) Superior performance: good consistency, compatible with metal and non-metal media
                <br>
                (3) More choices: printing, coding, customer customization
                <br>
                (4) Low price: 20%-50% lower than similar products on the market

            <h3>UHF PVC card (EN)</h3>
            <p>
                (1) Based on independent intellectual property development, the label adapts to the global frequency band work setting
                <br>
                (2) The linear polarization design has ultra-high reading rate in a specific direction and high tag recognition sensitivity
                <br>
                (3) High anti-counterfeiting performance, with unique identification code (TID code)
                <br>
                (4) Widely used in book file management, road automatic toll collection, access control card, membership card, city card card and other certificate cards, etc.

                This label is an electronic label encapsulated with a special material, which technically solves the problem that the electronic label cannot be attached to the metal surface. The product is waterproof, acid-proof, alkali-proof, and anti-collision, and can be used outdoors. Attaching the anti-metal electronic tag to the metal can obtain good reading performance. At the same time, it complies with EPC C1G2 (ISO 18000-6C) standard, and the operating frequency is 860MHz~960MHz. It can be used worldwide, and the RFID chip will store unique identification and other updated information.
